# Stickers Always Shown v1.2.1

Adjusted to work with Balatro 1.0.1f

## Updates:
**Compatibility with Balatro 1.0.1f**: The mod has been updated to be fully compatible with the latest version of Balatro.
**New Sticker Support**: Added functionality to ensure that the new "Rental" and "Perishable" stickers are always visible, alongside other Joker stickers. This update ensures all stickers are consistently displayed across the application.
**Enhanced Sticker Retrieval Algorithm**: Implemented a new method to fetch and display stickers, significantly reducing memory usage. This optimization ensures that the mod performs efficiently, even under conditions where numerous stickers are present.

## Bug Fixes:
**Resolved Amber Acorn Blind Issue:** Previously, the mod incorrectly displayed stickers on both sides of the jokers, contrary to its intended design. This release fixes the issue by ensuring that stickers are visible only on the front side, even when encountering the Amber Acorn scenario. This update prevents players from unintentionally identifying jokers by the back-side stickers.
**Adaptation to New Framework Changes:** Adjustments have been made to the mod's codebase to align with the latest changes in Balatro's framework, ensuring smooth integration and functionality.
